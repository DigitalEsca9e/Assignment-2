		<p class="notes">The following are some TV shows that I've found entertaining while enlightening.
			This is just personal opinion and recommendations for anyone interested.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#fl">Fault Lines</a></li>
			<li><a href="#tls">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a></li>
			<li><a href="#dh">Dunk History</a></li>
			<li><a href="#cos">Cosmos</a></li>
		</ul>
		<ol>
			<li><h3><a name="fl">Fault Lines</a></h3>
			<img src="https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/628822058_780x439.jpg" alt="Fault Lines"/>
			
				<p><strong>Fault Lines is a documentary series highlighting events around the world that needs attention.   
							For each episode the team focuses on a major problem and tries to find out what's causing it.
							What I like most about their documentaries is that they are complete, i.e they give enough 
							information for the audience to have a firm understanding of the problem. For me it provides
							the chance for constructive thinking; as I have a tendency to think a lot; and apply those 
							solutions in everyday life. This may sound weird but most big problems are magnified small
							problems.</strong></p>

			<li><h3><a name="tls">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a></h3>

			<p><strong>While I'm a fan of lot of the Late Show host's, Stephen Colbert by far is my favorite. The best part
						of the show are his beginning monologues and I especially like his deliveries. What I find best 
						about the show is that it introduces people from all walks of life and not just celebrities. While
						other shows do this too I find that it's not as pronounced.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li><h3><a name="dh">Drunk History</a></h3>
			<img src="https://www.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450/d/drunk_history.jpg" alt="Drunk History"/>
			
				<p><strong>Drunk History is series in which each episode focuses on a particular event in history. The event 
							is described or narrated by a guest celebrity but only after getting drunk. In the drunken state 
							the celebrities often overly simplify the language used or use modern day slangs for some of the 
							dialog. The scenes are then re-enacted by actors who lip-sync to their drunken narrator to give
							a fun spin to the story.</strong></p>
			</li>
			<li><h3><a name="cos">Cosmos</a></h3>
			<img src="https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cosmos.jpg" alt="Cosmos"/>
			
				<p><strong>Cosmos is a short TV series with only one season but the information it covers would give anyone 
							a basic knowledge of astronomy. The TV show looks at the entire history of the universe as a 
							calendar. They go on to explain the big bang, the formation of the earth and the evolution of 
							astronomy as a science as well as what it did for mankind. The language in the show is simplified
							making it understandable and easy to follow. For anyone with an interest in astronomy or the 
							physical universe this show is a must watch.</strong></p>
